  <div class="span1"><h3>Intemezzo</h3></div>
  <div class="span1"><p>Composed for Prof. Yinam Leef's harmony class in 2010, this Intermezzo in the style of Brahms is a piece I am very fond of. Although not really much more than an exercise in 19th century form and harmony, I am very proud of the results. Performed by my lovely wife, Talia Amar.</p></div>
