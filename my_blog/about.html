  	I am a creator, a programmer, and a musician. I love building things, and am constantly challenging myself to learn new technologies. Music is a big part of who I am. I play guitar and compose on my spare time. I enjoy going out to concerts and the opera whenever possible. <br />
  	<br />
  	During the past few years I have coded in more languages than I can count, including Lisp, Matlab, and Prolog. I am very comfortable in Java and C/C++, and am fascinated by functional programming.
I love Machine Learning. One of my favorite courses at NYU was Foundation of Machine Learning with Professor Mehryar Mohri, and I hope to do more with Machine Learning in the future. <br />
	<br />
  	One of the best decisions of my life was to move to Manhattan (Upper West Side). I came here in 2012 to earn my Master's in Computer Science from NYU and have been enjoying every minute of it. <br />
  	<br />

Since October 2013 I have been a tech co-founder at <a href="http://www.nabbtix.com">NabbTix</a>, an exciting startup in the event ticketing space.
