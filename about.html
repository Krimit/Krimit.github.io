      I am a software engineer, a data scientist, and a musician. I love building things, and am constantly challenging myself to learn new technologies. Machine Learning is one of my passions, and I derive great satisfaction from getting something magical to happen from a heap of data. Music is a big part of who I am and I play guitar in my spare time (my newest addition is a Fender Elite). I enjoy going out to concerts whenever possible and am something of a board game nerd. I travel with my family whenever possible, and our magnet collection is a testament to how many countries we've visited. <br />
